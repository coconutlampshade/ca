# Cellular Automata - Rule 30

An interactive visualization of Rule 30, a one-dimensional cellular automaton introduced by Stephen Wolfram. 

## Features
- Click on the top row to set initial cells
- Generate random initial states with adjustable density
- Control animation speed
- Infinite scroll mode
- Start, stop, and reset controls

## Rule 30 Explanation
Each cell's next state is determined by its current state and its two neighbors according to Rule 30:
- 111 → 0
- 110 → 0
- 101 → 0
- 100 → 1
- 011 → 1
- 010 → 1
- 001 → 1
- 000 → 0

The name "Rule 30" comes from the binary number 00011110 (30 in decimal) formed by reading these output states.
